Description:
Designed and implemented a versatile up/down counter using Verilog HDL. The counter supports enable, reset, and load functions, and can count both upwards and downwards based on control signals. Developed and simulated the design in ModelSim and integrated it into a Quartus Prime project, demonstrating proficiency in sequential logic and digital design.

Key Skills:
Verilog HDL
Digital Design
Sequential Logic
Simulation and Synthesis (ModelSim, Quartus Prime)
